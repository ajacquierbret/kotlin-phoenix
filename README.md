This project is aimed to allow developers to work with Phoenix Channels in Kotlin Multiplatform projects, and is composed of several modules:

- A modern Kotlin Multiplatform Phoenix Channels client, built with coroutines.
- Adapters designed for specific GraphQL clients (e.g. Apollo Client) allowing them to handle subscriptions via Phoenix Channels

**As of now, this project is still experimental and should NOT be used in production.
Please feel free to contribute and to share feedbacks and issues.**

## Modules

- [Kotlin Phoenix Client](https://github.com/ajacquierbret/kotlin-phoenix/tree/main/kotlinphoenix-client)
- [Kotlin Phoenix Adapters](https://github.com/ajacquierbret/kotlin-phoenix/tree/main/kotlinphoenix-adapters)

## Installation

Add the `mavenCentral` repository

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts

repositories {
  mavenCentral()
}
```

Add the `kotlinphoenix` dependency in `commonMain` source set.

```kotlin
// shared/build.gradle.kts

sourceSets {
  val commonMain by getting {
    dependencies {
	implementation("io.github.ajacquierbret:kotlinphoenix-$moduleName:1.0.3")
    }
  }
}
```

Enable coroutines multithreading (required for iOS)

```kotlin
// gradle.properties

kotlin.native.binary.memoryModel=experimental
```

If some of your dependencies rely on coroutines, please force the dependency resolution to version `1.6.0-native-mt` with:

```kotlin
// shared/build.gradle.kts

implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core:1.6.0-native-mt") {
    version {
        strictly("1.6.0-native-mt")
    }
}
```

OR :

```kotlin
// shared/build.gradle.kts

configurations {
    all {
        resolutionStrategy {
            force("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core:1.6.0-native-mt")
            force("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-android:1.6.0-native-mt")
        }
    }
}
```

## Usage

See each module's documentation for example usages.

## Roadmap

- [x] Fork and re-design the [JavaPhoenixClient](https://github.com/dsrees/JavaPhoenixClient) library in order to build a Multiplatform library (at least iOS & Android), using `OkHttp` for Android and `NSUrlSession` for iOS
- [x] Switch all the [JavaPhoenixClient](https://github.com/dsrees/JavaPhoenixClient) library callbacks to a coroutine based approach
- [x] Publish this brand new library as [Kotlin Phoenix Client](https://github.com/ajacquierbret/kotlin-phoenix/tree/main/kotlinphoenix-client) on Github and Maven
- [x] Create a [PhoenixNetworkTransport](https://github.com/ajacquierbret/kotlin-phoenix/blob/main/kotlinphoenix-adapters/src/commonMain/kotlin/io/github/ajacquierbret/kotlinphoenix/adapters/apollo/PhoenixNetworkTransport.kt) adapter for Apollo Kotlin using Kotlin Phoenix Client, which will be available in the same repo, but inside another module.
- [ ] Clean both module's code and add detailed comment blocks
- [ ] Host Dokka generated API reference on Github Pages (API ref. is already generated by Dokka at `/dokka`, it just needs to go live)
- [ ] Write and host proper documentation
- [ ] Mock a simple Phoenix server & test the Kotlin Phoenix library
- [ ] Encourage the community to contribute to the project
